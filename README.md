# elgentos TurpentineExtended

This extension bans (flushes) all category pages of any given product when that product is saved in the Magento backend. This is sometimes necessary, for example when the special price is used frequently. It also boasts a 'shotgun mode', which means every URL in Varnish will be banned that matches the url key of the categories of that product.
